## I've noticed an uptick in Manhwa Guillotines
For context I've always been puzzled why Manhwa had not tried to compete with manga when it comes to the type of content generally available. But so far there is five Manhwa out now where the main villainess is guillotined rather than plain old beheaded, or even hung.

Beheadings in general are not anything particularly new to manga or manhwa, but the unique aspect is how Manhwa guillotines seem to be noteably more realistically designed than the ones in Manga, with perhaps the exception being Innocent Rouge.

This poses an interesting question to me, and I've begun to wonder if I've been trying to market in the wrong places, as someone whom had historically been also a huge fan of manhwa as well.

My style of content has generally revolved more around romance, but tended to be serial murderesses whom would get the chop at the end of the story. Rather than the hangman's noose. Often this would even be the case even in settings set in the United States at as ( Les Etats-Unis ).

I may end up doing some research, as the setting I have built actually allows for Korean main characters, even though the setting is otherwise split between Japanese West Coast and French East Coast.

But it would be something if it turned out it's actually manhwa that is more receptive to my kind of work.
